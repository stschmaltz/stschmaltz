## 👋 Hey there!

I’m currently a **Staff Software Engineer at [EdVisorly](https://www.edvisorly.com)**, building systems that streamline college-transfer pathways.  

#### Previously:

- **Staff Software Engineer / Manager – Boulevard** (payments fintech)
- **Staff Software Engineer – Jobber** (invoicing fintech)
- **Staff Software Engineer & Team Lead – Neo Financial** (scaled from 0 ➜ 1 M+ users, employee 22 -> ~800 when I left)

My happy place is where **product value, clean architecture, and developer experience** intersect. 

I love building for the user and I love to build fast.
