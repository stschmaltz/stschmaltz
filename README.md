## Hey 👋

I'm a staff engineer with over 10 years building and scaling fintech and SaaS products. Currently a founding engineer at **[EdVisorly](https://www.edvisorly.com)**, building the platform end to end.

I care deeply about building the right thing for the user, owning complex systems, and leveling up the people around me. I ship fast and I build things that hold up.

- **Staff Software Engineer — Jobber** · Invoicing tech lead. Owned systems behind multi-billion-dollar annual transaction volumes.
- **Staff Software Engineer & Team Lead — Neo Financial** · Employee #22. Helped scale from zero to 1M+ users and ~800 employees.

## Outside of Work

- 🏂 **Snowboarding** — In the Rockies as much as possible. Louise, Sunshine, Kicking Horse.

- 🥁 **Drumming** — Self-taught, still learning. Built Practice Pal partly to track my own progress.
- 🐉 **D&D** — I DM a regular campaign and I've built two apps to support it.
- 🎵 **Music** — Always digging for something new. Send me a recommendation.
- 🐈 **Cats** — Two of them. They run the house.
